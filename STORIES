PILLBOX STORIES

Date & Time Info Refactor
- currently storing date and time info in a Date object
- this is a terrible way to store this info
- either build a timestamp or just store everything as ints
- Files to modify:
	- Medicine.java
	- AddMedsAction
	- AddMedsView

Implement Add Meds Action
- Save
	x - SpinnerAdapter in AddMedsAction.java for freq_taken_units
	- new up and populate Medicine obj
	- figure out how to persist data lol
- Date Selection
	- add a calendar widget to the Add Meds View that will let the user set a start date
	- this will be way simpler than what I'm doing now
- Cancel

Implement View My Meds View/Action
- Just do a bulleted list for now
- Should show med name, dose desc, time taken, freq taken, is as-needed

Implement Med Reminder Functionality
- Set alarm upon med creation

FUTURE

Add support for irregular dose intervals for meds

Add med tracking history

Make the Add Meds View look less terrible

BUGS

Fix TimePicker in Add Meds
- timepickermode param only available for API lvl 21+
- will break for older versions of Android
- without that setting on Lollipop, clock widget will not display correctly
- FIX IT

COMPLETED

Add Buttons & Title to Main Menu
- "Pillbox"
- Take Meds
- Add Meds
- View My Meds
- Edit My Meds

	- numeric input field
	- spinner
